COMP200-Rex-Assembly-Programing-Lab5

This assembly programing has both source code and object files. You need to use RexSimulator to test the object file.

RexSimulator Download Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexsimulator/?source=directory# Rex-Assembly-Lab5

This is a Round Robin Kernel Source Code using Rex Assembly programing. The Karnel can be interrupted and running the 2 jobs 
at the same time. When the user or programm interrupted, the interrupt handler will save all the registers inside the Process Control Block (PCB), and then it will handle the interrupt request. 

Curretnly, the kernel will work 2 jobs at the same time. At the terminal 1, the timmer running and at the terminal-2 you can play the game by pressing "Spacebar" from keyboard. 

Please load the "lab5_5.srec" to the RexSimulator and see the works. 

You need to create a new file in terminal 2. Currently this won't be working. To test you should run .serc file and see the demo. 
Good luck.
